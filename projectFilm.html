                <h2>Project Two</h2>
                <h3>Storyboarding, film, & production design</h3>
                <div class = textSpacer></div>

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>As part of learning about new media, my team was tasked to design, film, and manage all aspects of the film-making process and emerge with an approximately 5-minute short film. My roles were storyboarding, production design, organizing casting, as well as contributing to writing and producing.</p>
                <p>-8 week project in Spring of 2022</p>
                <p>-Tools: </p>
                <p>-Team: Joshua Chin, Triane Tambay, Anika Richards, Alexis Lee</p>
                <h4>Ideation</h4>
                <p>Our films idea initially began as a mockumentary, a satirical version of a traditional documentary. While we settled on a more traditional type of story to consolidate what we had within the 5-minute constraints, remnants of the interview format still remain. We wanted to tell a twisted, thriller type of story and drafted a short mood board. As well, in pre-production, my main focus was on creating the storyboard that would guide us through filming.</p>

                <h4>Creation</h4>
                <p>The process of creating a film taught me the dedication needed for project management. As I was the main link of communication between the cast and crew, I realized how strongly team project successes are defined upon dedication, proactiveness, and of course communication. In our case, one “curveball” we faced during filming was a possible exposure during the covid-19 pandemic. Reorganizing, accommodating for everyone, and reflecting on the most important next steps were some of the solutions I was forced to implement.</p>
                <p>It was also important listening to critiques of our work during development. The films end sequence was mentioned as being in need of more impact and self-realization. We restructured the ending story shift to heighten and better imply the protagonist’s motivations.</p>

                <h4>In Retrospect</h4>
                <p>Before this project, I contemplated and worried about how I could actually meaningfully contribute, considering that film was not something I had done before. However, I was able to identify my strengths and find openings to work with, as well as being able to widen my skillset and develop soft skills like leadership and adaptability in a project setting. </p>
