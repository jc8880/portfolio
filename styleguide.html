            <h3>branding</h3>
            <div class = "singleColumnContainer">
                <p>The portfolio branding balances the simplicity and clarity of the user experience with organic and creative touches in-line with the freehand work of an illustrator. The intent of the design is to maintain exceptionally easy to use site navigation and add creative/personality based touches where possible.</p>
                <p>The brand colour scheme focuses on pairing a light purple with black or dark gray, plus the background use of white.</p>
                <h3 class = container>#9987BD</h3>
                <h4 class = container>#3b3b3b</h4>

                <p>The font, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Urbanist">Urbanist</a> also reinforces the clarity aspect of the brand, however it carries a friendlier look than a more simplistic sans serif font.</p>
                <p>Regular: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 0123456789</p>
                <h4>Bold: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 0123456789</h4>

                <p>The brand imagery used to add personality to the site represents a digital illustrated style. It is well defined by outlines and organization, but can also contain intentional imperfections for a more hand-drawn feel. It can be compared to designs done by fashion illustrators.</p>

                    <h3>Project One: Storyboarding, film, & production design</h3>
                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>As part of learning about new media, my team was tasked to design, film, and manage all aspects of the film-making process and emerge with an approximately 5-minute short film. My roles were storyboarding, production design, organizing casting, as well as contributing to writing and producing.</p>
                    <p>-8 week project in Spring of 2022</p>
                    <p>-Team: Joshua Chin, Triane Tambay, Anika Richards, Alexis Lee</p>
                    <h4>Ideation</h4>
                    <p>Our films idea initially began as a mockumentary, a satirical version of a traditional documentary. While we settled on a more traditional type of story to consolidate what we had within the 5-minute constraints, remnants of the interview format still remain. We wanted to tell a twisted, thriller type of story and drafted a short mood board. As well, in pre-production, my main focus was on creating the storyboard that would guide us through filming.</p>

                    <img class = styleGuideImg src="img/img/filmProject/storyboardOnWall.png" alt="">

                    <h4>Creation</h4>
                    <p>The process of creating a film taught me the dedication needed for project management. As I was the main link of communication between the cast and crew, I realized how strongly team project successes are defined upon dedication, proactiveness, and of course communication. In our case, one “curveball” we faced during filming was a possible exposure during the covid-19 pandemic. Reorganizing, accommodating for everyone, and reflecting on the most important next steps were some of the solutions I was forced to implement.</p>
                    <p>It was also important listening to critiques of our work during development. The films end sequence was mentioned as being in need of more impact and a realization moment for the protagonist. We restructured the story shift at the end to better develop and clearly show the protagonist’s motivations.</p>

                    <h4>In Retrospect</h4>
                    <p>Before this project, I contemplated and worried about how I could actually meaningfully contribute, considering that film was not something I had done before. However, I was able to identify my strengths and find openings to work with, as well as being able to widen my skillset and develop soft skills like leadership and adaptability in a project setting. </p>

                    <h3>Project Two: Illustration & case study</h3>
                    <h4>Background</h4>
                    <p>In the world of theme park design, Disney California Adventure in Anaheim, California is a model for numerous missteps before becoming what it is today. The park’s overarching theme aimed to capture and honour the vast state of California within a single entertainment destination. When it opened, it struggled to offer an engaging and inspirational experience that both the state of California and Disney’s products traditionally embody.</p>

                    <h4>Goal</h4>
                    <p>My goal was to redesign and illustrate a different scenario in which the park would have been successful in capturing and honouring California culture in a Disney theme park format.</p>
                    <p>-Personal Project in early 2023</p>
                    <p>-Individual</p>

                    <h4>Concept</h4>
                    <p>In this redesign concept, Disney California Adventure is divided into six themed “lands” that each draw from different aspects of California’s history and influential locations. I decided to take inspiration from a variety of real-world locations, including the current theme park that exists today.</p>

                    <p>Paradise Pier was an existing area of the theme park that brought to life traditional California beaches and boardwalks. In this iteration, I first established a fun, but classic colour scheme for the land.</p>
                    <img class = styleGuideImg src="img/img/dcaProject/dcaParadisePierColours.png" alt="">
                    <p>I looked at the Pacific Coast Highway, a major route along the coast to influence the design, which contains a range of cliffs extending along the water.</p>

                    <p>A new aspect of the design is Golden Valley, a land that honours rural parts of California, including Wine Country and vintage Gold Rush towns.</p>

                    <img class = styleGuideImg src="img/img/dcaProject/dca case study art.png" alt="">
                    <p>From this concept, I have been able to better explore what makes immersive design compelling, and how one can have an entertainment destination but maintain elements of education, appreciation, and discovery for rich cultures and traditions.</p>
